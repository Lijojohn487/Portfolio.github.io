							<p class="justify-text">With over 3 years of experience as a Big4 Tax Senior, I have consistently delivered exceptional tax and payroll services to Fortune 500 companies. My expertise lies in Global Compensation, Assignment Services, International Payroll, US Taxation, Global Mobility, and Expatriate Management. I possess an in-depth understanding of the complex tax laws that impact multinational corporations, ensuring compliance with local and international regulations.

My role at Deloitte as a personal income tax preparer for Globally Mobile Employees (Cross border Tax) )further enhanced my skills. I prepared Canadian and US tax returns for globally mobile employees, managed CRA inquiries, and contributed to advisory projects spanning various aspects of global mobility. Leveraging tax software, I accurately calculated tax liabilities to optimize savings for clients while staying up-to-date with evolving tax regulations.

Recognized by peers and superiors, I have received multiple awards for my dedication and exceptional client service. My commitment to maintaining positive client relationships and delivering high-quality work has been the hallmark of my career. With a strong focus on tax, payroll, global compensation, and global mobility, I am driven to embrace new challenges and opportunities, continuously expanding my skills to assist clients in achieving their financial goals</p>
